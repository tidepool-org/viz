// TODO: this component should render a line connecting the smbgs from a single day
// it has two or three potential states:
// - grouping on: the y-position of each point on the line segment
//   is the average of all the smbgs in the group
//   NB: when grouping is on, no line hover interaction
// - grouping off: just connect the dots!
//   but also include a 2nd, fatter invisible line with onMouseOver & onMouseOut handlers
//   for the line to "focus" the whole day
//   (there seems to be a regression on prod re: the rendering of the fatter invisible lines)
// - [maybe] day is focused (through hover) fatter & solid line connecting the dots
//   this style also applies when a single smbg is focused
