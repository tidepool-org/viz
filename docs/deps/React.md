## @tidepool/viz's usage of React

Aside from [our general views on React best practices at Tidepool](http://developer.tidepool.io/docs/front-end/react/index.html 'Tidepool developer portal: React @ Tidepool'), to develop code in this repository you should:

- understand the division between "container" components (handle data/logic) and "pure" components (handle rendering) - see [Code Style](../CodeStyle.md)
- understand [how we use D3 and React together]('./D3.md')
